# Cyberattack

## Definition

A cyberattack is a deliberate attempt by individuals or groups to breach the security of computer systems, networks, or devices. The goal is often to steal data, disrupt operations, or cause harm to organizations or individuals.

## How It Works

Cyberattacks can take many forms, including malware, phishing, denial-of-service, and ransomware. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities, use social engineering, or deploy automated tools to gain access or cause damage.

## Real-World Application

Cyberattacks target businesses, governments, and individuals. High-profile incidents include data breaches, election interference, and critical infrastructure sabotage. Cybersecurity teams use monitoring, incident response, and threat intelligence to defend against attacks.

Imagine a digital burglar breaking into a vault, bypassing alarms and stealing valuable information.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a team of hackers in a movie, racing against the clock to outsmart security systems and pull off a digital heist.

## Why It Matters

Cyberattacks are a constant threat in the digital world, making robust defenses and awareness essential for everyone.
