# Cybersquatting

## Definition

Cybersquatting is the act of registering, trafficking in, or using an internet domain name with the intent to profit from the goodwill of someone else’s trademark or brand. It is considered an unfair and often illegal practice.

## How It Works

Cybersquatters register domain names similar to established brands, hoping to sell them at a profit or mislead users. Legal remedies include the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) and trademark lawsuits.

## Real-World Application

Cybersquatting affects businesses, celebrities, and organizations. It can lead to lost revenue, reputational harm, and legal battles.

Imagine someone setting up a fake storefront with your company’s name, tricking customers and cashing in on your reputation.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a digital pirate staking claim to a valuable island, demanding a ransom for its return.

## Why It Matters

Cybersquatting undermines trust in the internet and highlights the importance of digital rights and protections.
