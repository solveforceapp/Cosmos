# Bounce

## Definition

A bounce is an email message that is returned to the sender as undeliverable. Bounces occur when an email cannot be delivered to the intended recipient, often due to incorrect addresses, full mailboxes, server issues, or spam filters. Bounces provide feedback about delivery failures and help maintain healthy communication systems.

## How It Works

When an email server cannot deliver a message, it generates a bounce notification (Non-Delivery Report, or NDR) to inform the sender of the problem. Bounces are classified as "hard" (permanent failure, such as an invalid address) or "soft" (temporary issue, like a full inbox). Email marketers and administrators monitor bounce rates to improve deliverability.

## Real-World Application

Bounces are important in email marketing, customer communication, and system administration. High bounce rates can harm sender reputation and trigger spam filters. Tools and best practices—such as list cleaning and double opt-in—help reduce bounces and ensure messages reach their audience.

Imagine sending a letter that comes back with a note: "No such address—return to sender."

Picture a boomerang that always returns if it can’t find its target, carrying a message about what went wrong.

## Why It Matters

Understanding bounces helps maintain effective, reliable communication in the digital world.
