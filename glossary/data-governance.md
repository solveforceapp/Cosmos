# Data Governance

## Definition

Data governance is the management of data availability, usability, integrity, and security within an organization. It is guided by policies, standards, and roles that ensure data is accurate, consistent, and protected.

## How It Works

Data governance frameworks define data ownership, quality controls, and compliance requirements. Committees or data stewards oversee implementation and continuous improvement.

## Real-World Application

Data governance is used in finance, healthcare, and government to meet regulatory requirements and support analytics. It enables better decision-making and risk management.

Imagine a team of librarians organizing a vast library, ensuring every book is in its place and easy to find.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a traffic cop directing data on a busy highway, preventing accidents and keeping everything flowing smoothly.

## Why It Matters

Data governance builds trust in data, supporting innovation and compliance.
