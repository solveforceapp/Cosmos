# Demarcation Point (Demarc)

## Definition

The demarcation point (demarc) is the physical location where a service provider’s network ends and the customer’s network begins. It is often marked by a device, jack, or panel, and serves as the boundary for responsibility and maintenance.

## How It Works

The demarc is typically installed at the customer’s premises, such as a building’s telecom room or utility closet. Service providers maintain everything up to the demarc, while customers are responsible for wiring and equipment beyond it. Demarcs can include network interface devices (NIDs), smart jacks, or optical network terminals (ONTs).

## Real-World Application

Demarcation points are found in homes, offices, and data centers. They simplify troubleshooting, clarify service agreements, and support upgrades or changes. Technicians use the demarc to test connectivity and isolate faults.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a fence dividing two yards—one side is the provider’s, the other is yours. Or picture a relay race where the baton is passed at a clearly marked line.

## Why It Matters

Demarcation points define ownership, responsibility, and support, making network management more efficient and transparent.
