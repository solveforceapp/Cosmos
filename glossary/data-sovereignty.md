# Data Sovereignty

## Definition

Data sovereignty is the concept that data is subject to the laws and governance structures of the country where it is collected, processed, or stored. It affects how organizations manage, transfer, and protect data across borders.

## How It Works

Laws like GDPR and data localization requirements dictate where data can reside. Organizations must assess legal risks and adapt infrastructure to comply.

## Real-World Application

Data sovereignty is crucial for multinational companies, cloud providers, and governments. It impacts cloud adoption, privacy, and security.

Imagine a passport for your data, determining where it can travel and who can access it.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a border guard checking every file’s paperwork before letting it cross into a new country.

## Why It Matters

Data sovereignty shapes the global flow of information and the future of digital rights.
