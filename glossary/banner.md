# Banner

## Definition

A banner is a message or notification displayed to users when they connect to a remote system, network device, or application. Banners provide information, warnings, or legal notices before login or access is granted, setting expectations and establishing terms of use.

## How It Works

System administrators configure banners on servers, routers, firewalls, and other devices. Banners may display system status, maintenance schedules, or security policies. Legal banners inform users of monitoring, consent, or acceptable use, supporting compliance and accountability.

## Real-World Application

Banners are used in corporate networks, government systems, and cloud services. They help prevent unauthorized access, communicate important updates, and protect organizations from liability. Security audits often require banners to be in place.

Imagine a sign at the entrance to a building, letting visitors know the rules before they enter.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a talking doormat that greets you with a message every time you step inside, reminding you to wipe your feet and behave.

## Why It Matters

Banners set the tone for digital interactions, promoting transparency, security, and responsible use.
