# Linguist

A **linguist** is a person who studies language scientifically. Linguists analyze the structure, function, history, and use of language, seeking to understand its underlying rules, patterns, and social significance. Their work spans the fields of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and more.

## Definition

A linguist may be a researcher, educator, translator, computational scientist, or language enthusiast. Linguists use empirical methods to collect and analyze language data, develop theories about language structure and change, and apply their findings to real-world problems.

## Key Roles

- **Theoretical Linguist:** Develops models of language structure and universals.
- **Applied Linguist:** Applies linguistic knowledge to education, translation, technology, and policy.
- **Field Linguist:** Documents and analyzes lesser-known or endangered languages.
- **Computational Linguist:** Designs algorithms for natural language processing and AI.

## Applications

- **Language Documentation:** Preserving linguistic diversity.
- **Language Teaching:** Improving methods for language acquisition.
- **Technology:** Enabling speech recognition, translation, and text analysis.
- **Forensics:** Analyzing language in legal contexts.

## Relation to Linguistics, Lanomics, and Cosmos

Linguists are central to the development of the Cosmos knowledge base, providing the expertise to analyze, model, and connect language systems. Their work underpins lanomics, autonomics, and the architecture of meaning.
