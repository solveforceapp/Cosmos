# Call Admission Control (CAC)

## Definition

Call Admission Control (CAC) is a mechanism in voice and video networks that regulates the initiation of new calls or sessions to ensure quality of service (QoS) and prevent network congestion. CAC helps maintain call quality by limiting the number of simultaneous connections based on available resources.

## How It Works

When a new call is requested, the CAC system checks network capacity, bandwidth, and policy rules. If resources are sufficient, the call is allowed; if not, the call is blocked or queued. CAC is often implemented in firewalls, routers, and session border controllers.

## Real-World Application

CAC is critical in VoIP, video conferencing, and unified communications. It ensures reliable service for business-critical applications and prevents network overload. Service providers and enterprises use CAC to guarantee performance and meet service level agreements (SLAs).

Imagine a restaurant host who only seats as many guests as the kitchen can handle, ensuring every meal is served hot and fresh.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a bouncer at a club who lets people in only when there’s enough room to dance, keeping the party lively but never overcrowded.

## Why It Matters

CAC protects the user experience, supporting clear, uninterrupted communication in busy networks.
