# Fixed Wireless

## Definition

Fixed wireless is a type of wireless communication that provides broadband internet access to a fixed location, such as a home or business, using radio signals instead of cables. It is an alternative to wired connections like DSL, cable, or fiber.

## How It Works

Fixed wireless systems use antennas and transceivers to connect customers to a nearby base station. Line-of-sight is often required for optimal performance. Fixed wireless can deliver high speeds over long distances, especially in rural or underserved areas.

## Real-World Application

Fixed wireless is used by ISPs to reach customers where laying cables is impractical or too expensive. It supports remote work, telemedicine, and distance learning.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a direct beam of internet from a tower to your house, like a spotlight illuminating your connection. Or picture a walkie-talkie that never runs out of range.

## Why It Matters

Fixed wireless expands access to high-speed internet, bridging the digital divide and supporting economic growth.
