# Autonomous System (AS)

## Definition

An Autonomous System (AS) is a collection of IP networks and routers under the control of a single organization that presents a common routing policy to the internet. Each AS is assigned a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN) for identification and routing purposes.

## How It Works

ASes use protocols like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange routing information with other ASes. This enables efficient, scalable, and resilient internet connectivity. An AS may represent an internet service provider (ISP), a large enterprise, or a university.

## Real-World Application

Autonomous Systems are the building blocks of the global internet. They enable traffic to flow between networks, support redundancy, and facilitate peering agreements. Network engineers manage ASes to optimize performance, security, and cost.

Imagine a network of highways, each managed by a different company, but all working together to move traffic across the country.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a fleet of ships, each with its own captain and crew, navigating the seas but sharing maps and signals to avoid collisions.

## Why It Matters

Understanding ASes is key to grasping how the internet works, evolves, and remains robust in the face of change.
