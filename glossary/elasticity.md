# Elasticity

## Definition

Elasticity is the ability of a cloud service or IT system to automatically scale resources up or down in response to changing demand. Elastic systems optimize performance and cost by matching capacity to workload in real time.

## How It Works

Cloud platforms use automation and orchestration to add or remove servers, storage, or bandwidth as needed. Elasticity enables applications to handle traffic spikes, seasonal changes, or unexpected surges without manual intervention.

## Real-World Application

E-commerce sites use elasticity to manage Black Friday sales. Streaming services scale up for popular events. Startups leverage elasticity to grow without overpaying for unused resources.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a concert hall that expands or shrinks to fit the audience, ensuring everyone has a seat but no space is wasted. Or picture a pizza shop that instantly hires more chefs when orders flood in, then lets them go when things quiet down.

## Why It Matters

Elasticity makes technology more efficient, affordable, and resilient, supporting innovation and growth.
