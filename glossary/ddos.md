# DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)

## Definition

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyberattack where multiple systems, often compromised computers or bots, overwhelm a target—such as a server, website, or network—with a flood of traffic. The goal is to disrupt normal operations, causing slowdowns, outages, or complete shutdowns.

## How It Works

Attackers use botnets (networks of infected devices) to send massive amounts of data or requests to the target. The sheer volume exhausts resources, making the service unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can target bandwidth, applications, or protocols, and may use techniques like amplification or reflection to increase impact.

## Real-World Application

DDoS attacks are used by cybercriminals, hacktivists, and even nation-states to disrupt businesses, extort money, or make political statements. Victims include banks, e-commerce sites, government agencies, and gaming platforms. Defenses include firewalls, traffic filtering, and cloud-based mitigation services.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a crowd of pranksters all calling the same pizza shop at once, jamming the phone lines so real customers can’t get through. Or picture a traffic jam so massive that no one can reach their destination.

## Why It Matters

DDoS attacks threaten the reliability and security of the internet. Understanding and defending against them is critical for business continuity and public trust.
