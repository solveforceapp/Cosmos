# Cipher

## Definition

A cipher is an algorithm or method used to encrypt and decrypt information, transforming readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) and vice versa. Ciphers are the foundation of cryptography, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.

## How It Works

Ciphers use mathematical rules and keys to scramble data. The sender encrypts the message with a key, and the recipient uses a corresponding key to decrypt it. There are many types of ciphers, including substitution, transposition, and modern block or stream ciphers.

## Real-World Application

Ciphers secure online banking, email, messaging, and government communications. They are used in protocols like SSL/TLS, VPNs, and encrypted storage. The strength of a cipher depends on its design and the secrecy of its keys.

Imagine writing a secret note in a special code only your friend can read, keeping your message safe from prying eyes.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a treasure map written in invisible ink, only revealed when held over a candle by the right person.

## Why It Matters

Ciphers are the guardians of privacy and security in the digital age, enabling safe communication and commerce.
