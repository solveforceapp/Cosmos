# DNS (Domain Name System)

## Definition

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system that translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites and services on the internet. DNS is often called the “phone book” of the internet.

## How It Works

When you enter a web address, your device queries DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address. DNS uses a distributed network of servers, including root, top-level domain (TLD), and authoritative servers. Caching speeds up lookups, while DNSSEC adds security.

## Real-World Application

Every internet-connected device relies on DNS to find websites, send emails, and connect to services. Businesses use DNS for branding, security, and traffic management. DNS attacks (like spoofing) can disrupt access and compromise security.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine asking a librarian for a book by title, and they instantly provide the shelf location. Or picture a GPS that translates street names into exact coordinates.

## Why It Matters

DNS makes the internet usable, scalable, and secure. It is essential for connectivity and digital identity.
