# ASCII File

## Definition

An ASCII file is a plain text file that uses the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character encoding. This means every character—letters, numbers, punctuation, and control codes—is represented by a unique 7-bit binary number. ASCII files are readable by humans and computers alike, making them the universal language of digital text.

## How It Works

ASCII files store data as a sequence of characters, each mapped to a specific ASCII value. For example, the letter "A" is represented by the number 65, while a space is 32. These files can be created, viewed, and edited with any standard text editor, such as Notepad, Vim, or nano. Because they contain no formatting or binary data, ASCII files are simple, portable, and compatible across platforms.

## Real-World Application

ASCII files are everywhere: configuration files, source code, logs, and documentation are often stored in this format. Developers use ASCII files to write programs, system administrators use them for scripts and settings, and users encounter them as README files or CSV data. Their simplicity makes them ideal for data exchange, version control, and automation.

Imagine a digital notebook where every page is written in clear, universal handwriting—anyone, anywhere, can read and understand it.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a time capsule filled with messages written in plain English, buried for future generations. ASCII files are the digital equivalent—ensuring your words can be read long after the software that created them is gone.

## Why It Matters

ASCII files are the backbone of interoperability in computing. They enable communication, collaboration, and preservation of information across decades and devices.
