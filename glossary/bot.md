# Bot

## Definition

A bot (short for "robot") is an automated software program designed to perform repetitive tasks, often at speeds and scales beyond human capability. Bots can be benign—helping with automation, information retrieval, or customer service—or malicious, as part of cyberattacks or spam campaigns.

## How It Works

Bots operate according to programmed instructions or artificial intelligence. They can interact with websites, applications, or networks, carrying out tasks like web scraping, data entry, or responding to user queries. Malicious bots may spread malware, launch denial-of-service attacks, or steal information.

## Real-World Application

Benign bots power search engines, chatbots, and social media automation. Malicious bots are used in botnets to coordinate attacks, send spam, or manipulate online content. Bot detection and management are critical for maintaining security and service quality.

Imagine a tireless assistant who never sleeps, handling routine chores so you can focus on more important work.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a swarm of helpful robots cleaning your house, but watch out—some might rearrange your furniture just for fun!

## Why It Matters

Bots shape the digital landscape, for better or worse. Understanding their roles helps us harness their power and defend against their risks.
