# Digital Signal

## Definition

A digital signal is a type of signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values, typically 0s and 1s. Digital signals are the foundation of modern telecommunications, computing, and electronics.

## How It Works

Digital signals encode information using binary code, making them resistant to noise and easy to process. They are transmitted over cables, fiber optics, or wirelessly, and are used in everything from cell phones to computers. Digital signals can be regenerated and amplified without loss of quality.

## Real-World Application

Digital signals power the internet, mobile networks, digital TV, and audio systems. They enable high-speed data transfer, error correction, and secure communication. Engineers use digital signals to design circuits, networks, and devices.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a series of light switches turning on and off to send messages in Morse code. Or picture a robot waving flags in a precise pattern to communicate across a distance.

## Why It Matters

Digital signals make technology faster, more reliable, and more versatile. They are the language of the digital age.
