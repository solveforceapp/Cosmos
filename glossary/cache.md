# Cache

## Definition

A cache is a high-speed storage layer that temporarily holds frequently accessed data, making it faster to retrieve and improving overall system performance. Caches are used in computers, networks, and applications to reduce latency and resource usage.

## How It Works

When data is requested, the system first checks the cache. If the data is present (a cache hit), it is returned quickly. If not (a cache miss), the data is fetched from the original source and stored in the cache for future use. Caches can be hardware (CPU, disk) or software (web browsers, databases).

## Real-World Application

Caching is essential for web performance, database optimization, and cloud computing. It speeds up websites, reduces server load, and enables smooth user experiences. Cache management strategies—such as eviction policies and size limits—balance speed and freshness.

Imagine a chef who keeps the most-used ingredients on the counter, saving trips to the pantry for every meal.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a librarian who memorizes the most popular books, instantly reciting them to eager readers.

## Why It Matters

Caching is the secret sauce behind fast, responsive technology, powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers.
