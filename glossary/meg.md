# Magnetoencephalography (MEG)

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain. MEG provides millisecond-level temporal resolution and is used to study brain function, map neural networks, and diagnose neurological disorders.

## How It Works

MEG uses highly sensitive sensors called SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) to detect the tiny magnetic fields generated by neuronal currents. The data are analyzed to localize brain activity, track neural oscillations, and map functional connectivity.

## Applications in Biotechnology

- **Brain Research:** MEG is used to study sensory processing, cognition, and brain dynamics in health and disease.
- **Surgical Planning:** The technique helps neurosurgeons identify critical brain regions before surgery.
- **Drug Development:** MEG monitors the effects of pharmaceuticals on brain activity.

## Applications in Neurotechnology

- **Epilepsy Diagnosis:** MEG localizes seizure foci for surgical intervention.
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces:** The technology informs the design of non-invasive neural interfaces.

## Educational Analogy

Think of MEG as a super-sensitive microphone, picking up the faintest whispers of brain activity from outside the skull.

## Importance

Magnetoencephalography is revolutionizing our ability to study and treat the brain. Its continued development is driving advances in neuroscience, medicine, and neurotechnology.
