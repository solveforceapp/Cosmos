# Brute Force Attack

## Definition

A brute force attack is a method of password or cryptographic key guessing that systematically tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found. Brute force attacks are commonly used in cyberattacks to break into accounts, decrypt data, or bypass security controls.

## How It Works

Attackers use automated tools to generate and test every possible password or key, starting with the simplest combinations and progressing to more complex ones. The process can be slow and resource-intensive, but it is guaranteed to succeed if enough time and computing power are available. Defenses include strong passwords, account lockouts, and rate limiting.

## Real-World Application

Brute force attacks target login pages, encrypted files, and wireless networks. Cybercriminals use them to steal credentials, access sensitive data, or disrupt services. Security professionals use controlled brute force testing to assess the strength of passwords and encryption.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a burglar trying every key on a giant key ring until one finally opens the door. Or picture a safecracker spinning every possible combination until the lock clicks open.

## Why It Matters

Brute force attacks highlight the importance of strong security practices. They remind us that simple passwords and weak encryption are easy targets for determined attackers.
