# Nanopore Sequencing

Nanopore sequencing is a cutting-edge DNA and RNA sequencing technology that uses tiny protein pores embedded in a membrane to read genetic information directly. As individual nucleic acid molecules pass through the nanopore, changes in electrical current are measured and translated into sequence data. Nanopore sequencing is transforming genomics, diagnostics, and biotechnology.

## How It Works

A voltage is applied across a membrane containing nanopores. As a DNA or RNA strand passes through a pore, each nucleotide causes a characteristic disruption in the current, allowing the sequence to be determined in real time. Nanopore sequencing can read long stretches of DNA or RNA, providing comprehensive genetic information.

## Applications in Biotechnology

- **Genomics:** Nanopore sequencing enables rapid, portable, and cost-effective genome analysis for research, medicine, and agriculture.
- **Pathogen Detection:** The technology is used for real-time identification of viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens.
- **Epigenetics:** Nanopore sequencing can detect chemical modifications to DNA and RNA.

## Applications in Neurotechnology

- **Brain Research:** Nanopore sequencing is used to study gene expression and epigenetic changes in the nervous system.
- **Personalized Medicine:** The technology enables individualized diagnosis and treatment based on genetic profiles.

## Educational Analogy

Think of nanopore sequencing as reading a string of beads by feeling their shape as they pass through a tiny hole.

## Importance

Nanopore sequencing is democratizing genomics and accelerating discoveries in biology, medicine, and neurotechnology.
