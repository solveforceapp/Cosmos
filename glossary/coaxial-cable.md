# Coaxial Cable

## Definition

Coaxial cable is a type of electrical cable with a central conductor, insulating layer, metallic shield, and outer cover. It is widely used for transmitting cable television, internet, and data signals due to its durability and resistance to interference.

## How It Works

The central conductor carries the signal, while the shield prevents electromagnetic interference. Coaxial cables support high-frequency signals and can be run over long distances without significant loss. Connectors like F-type or BNC are used for secure connections.

## Real-World Application

Coaxial cables are found in homes, offices, and data centers, connecting TVs, modems, and network equipment. They are also used in CCTV systems and radio transmitters.

Imagine a pipeline that delivers both water and electricity, protected from leaks and outside noise.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a sturdy tunnel where messages travel safely, shielded from storms and eavesdroppers.

## Why It Matters

Coaxial cables are the backbone of many communication systems, ensuring reliable, high-quality signal transmission.
