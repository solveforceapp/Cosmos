# Failover

## Definition

Failover is the automatic switching to a standby system, server, or network in the event of a failure, ensuring continuous availability of services. It is a key strategy for high availability and disaster recovery.

## How It Works

Failover systems monitor the health of primary resources and instantly transfer operations to backups if a problem is detected. This can be achieved through redundant hardware, clustering, or cloud-based solutions.

## Real-World Application

Banks, hospitals, and e-commerce sites use failover to maintain uptime and protect against outages. Cloud providers offer failover as a service for critical applications.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a relay race where a backup runner is always ready to take over if the first runner stumbles. Or picture a power generator that kicks in the moment the lights go out.

## Why It Matters

Failover ensures business continuity, customer satisfaction, and resilience in the face of unexpected events.
