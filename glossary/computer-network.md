# Computer Network

## Definition

A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices and systems that communicate and share resources using wired or wireless technologies. Networks enable data exchange, collaboration, and access to shared services.

## How It Works

Networks use hardware (routers, switches, cables) and protocols (TCP/IP, Wi-Fi) to connect devices. They can be local (LAN), wide-area (WAN), or global (internet). Security, scalability, and performance are key considerations.

## Real-World Application

Computer networks power businesses, schools, and homes. They support cloud computing, remote work, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Imagine a web of roads connecting cities, allowing people and goods to travel freely.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a spider weaving a network of threads, connecting every corner of its domain.

## Why It Matters

Computer networks are the foundation of modern life, enabling communication, innovation, and progress.
