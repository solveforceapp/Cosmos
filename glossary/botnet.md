# Botnet

## Definition

A botnet is a network of computers, devices, or servers that have been infected with malware and are controlled remotely by an attacker, known as a botmaster. Botnets are used to launch coordinated cyberattacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), spam campaigns, or data theft.

## How It Works

Botnet malware infects devices through phishing, vulnerabilities, or malicious downloads. Once compromised, the devices (bots or zombies) receive commands from the botmaster via command-and-control (C2) servers. Botnets can be vast, spanning millions of devices worldwide, and are often rented out for criminal purposes.

## Real-World Application

Botnets are responsible for some of the largest cyberattacks in history, disrupting websites, stealing credentials, and spreading ransomware. Security professionals use detection tools, network monitoring, and takedown operations to combat botnets. Users can protect themselves by updating software and avoiding suspicious links.

Imagine an army of sleeper agents, all following orders from a distant mastermind, striking at a moment’s notice.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a puppet master controlling thousands of marionettes, each moving in perfect unison to create chaos or mischief.

## Why It Matters

Botnets are a major threat to cybersecurity, privacy, and the stability of the internet.
