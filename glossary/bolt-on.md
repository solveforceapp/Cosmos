# Bolt-On

## Definition

A bolt-on is an optional service, feature, or add-on that can be attached to a main product, license, or tariff. Bolt-ons allow customers to customize and expand their core services, tailoring solutions to specific needs without overhauling the entire package.

## How It Works

Bolt-ons are offered by telecom providers, software vendors, and subscription services. Customers select bolt-ons—such as extra data, international calling, premium support, or advanced features—to enhance their base plan. Bolt-ons are typically billed separately and can be added or removed as needs change.

## Real-World Application

Bolt-ons are common in mobile phone plans, cloud services, and enterprise software. They provide flexibility, scalability, and cost control. Businesses use bolt-ons to adapt to growth, seasonal demand, or new technologies without major disruptions.

Imagine a modular toolkit where you add only the tools you need for a specific job, keeping your kit light and efficient.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a superhero costume with detachable gadgets and upgrades, letting you power up for any challenge.

## Why It Matters

Bolt-ons empower users to personalize their services, driving innovation and satisfaction in competitive markets.
