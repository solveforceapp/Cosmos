# CDR (Call Detail Record)

## Definition

A Call Detail Record (CDR) is a digital file or database entry that contains detailed information about telephone calls, such as time, duration, origin, destination, and cost. CDRs are used for billing, analysis, and regulatory compliance in telecom systems.

## How It Works

Telecom switches and PBX systems generate CDRs for every call. The records are collected, stored, and processed for invoicing, reporting, and troubleshooting. CDRs may include additional data, such as call quality or features used.

## Real-World Application

CDRs are vital for telecom providers, businesses, and law enforcement. They support accurate billing, fraud detection, and network optimization. Privacy and data protection are important considerations in CDR management.

Imagine a detailed receipt for every phone call, showing exactly what happened and when.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a detective’s notebook, filled with clues about every conversation in town.

## Why It Matters

CDRs provide transparency, accountability, and insights for better communication and business decisions.
