# Hypervisor

## Definition

A hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines by abstracting hardware resources, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical host. Hypervisors are the backbone of virtualization and cloud computing.

## How It Works

Hypervisors allocate CPU, memory, and storage to each virtual machine (VM), isolating them for security and performance. There are Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors, each with unique advantages.

## Real-World Application

Data centers, cloud providers, and developers use hypervisors to run multiple workloads on shared hardware, optimize resources, and enable rapid scaling.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a hotel where each guest has a private suite, or a stage where many actors perform different plays at the same time. Or picture a magician who can split a single object into many copies, each doing its own job.

## Why It Matters

Hypervisors drive efficiency, flexibility, and innovation in IT infrastructure.
