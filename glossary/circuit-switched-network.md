# Circuit-Switched Network

## Definition

A circuit-switched network is a type of communication network that establishes a dedicated, continuous connection between two endpoints for the entire duration of a session. This approach is most famously used in traditional telephone systems, where a physical path is reserved for each call.

## How It Works

When a call is made, switches in the network connect a series of circuits, creating a direct line between the caller and receiver. This path remains exclusive until the call ends, ensuring consistent quality and low latency. However, the dedicated nature can be inefficient if the line is idle.

## Real-World Application

Circuit-switched networks are used in landline telephony, private branch exchanges (PBX), and some legacy data networks. While packet-switched networks dominate modern communications, circuit switching is still valued for applications requiring guaranteed bandwidth and reliability.

Imagine a private train track laid just for your journey, with no stops or detours until you reach your destination.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a red carpet rolled out just for you, and no one else can walk on it until you’re done!

## Why It Matters

Circuit-switched networks set the stage for global voice communication and still influence how we design reliable networks today.
