# Denial of Service (DoS)

## Definition

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack that disrupts the normal functioning of a network, service, or website by overwhelming it with excessive traffic or requests. The goal is to make the target unavailable to legitimate users.

## How It Works

Attackers flood the target with more requests than it can handle, exhausting resources like bandwidth, memory, or processing power. DoS attacks can be simple (single source) or complex (using multiple vectors). Defenses include rate limiting, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

## Real-World Application

DoS attacks have targeted banks, news sites, and online games, causing downtime and financial losses. Hacktivists and cybercriminals use DoS to protest, extort, or disrupt competitors. Businesses invest in mitigation tools to protect their services.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a single prankster repeatedly pressing a doorbell until the homeowner can’t answer real guests. Or picture a restaurant so crowded with fake diners that no one else can get a table.

## Why It Matters

DoS attacks threaten the reliability and trustworthiness of digital services. Awareness and prevention are key to maintaining uptime and user confidence.
