# Converged Network

## Definition

A converged network is an infrastructure that combines voice, data, and video communications onto a single platform. This integration simplifies management, reduces costs, and supports unified communications.

## How It Works

Converged networks use IP-based technologies to transmit different types of traffic over the same infrastructure. Quality of Service (QoS) ensures performance for critical applications.

## Real-World Application

Businesses, schools, and hospitals use converged networks to support VoIP, video conferencing, and data sharing. They enable flexible work environments and efficient resource use.

Imagine a superhighway where cars, trucks, and buses all travel smoothly in their own lanes.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a single remote control that operates your TV, lights, and music system—all in perfect harmony.

## Why It Matters

Converged networks pave the way for smarter, more connected organizations.
