# Axiom

**Axiom** is a foundational statement or principle accepted as true without proof, serving as a starting point for reasoning and inference within a system. In mathematics, logic, and philosophy, axioms are the bedrock upon which theorems and further knowledge are built. In the Cosmos knowledge base, axioms define the irreducible truths or laws that underlie the architecture of meaning, language, and systems.

## Definition

An axiom is a self-evident or universally accepted proposition. It is not derived from other statements but is used to generate further truths through logical inference. Axioms are essential for establishing consistency and coherence within any formal system.

## Key Features

- **Self-Evidence:** Accepted as true without proof.
- **Foundational:** Serves as the basis for further reasoning.
- **Universal or System-Specific:** May be general (e.g., in logic) or tailored to a particular domain (e.g., geometry, linguistics).

## Applications

- **Mathematics:** The basis for all mathematical proofs and systems.
- **Logic:** Underpins deductive reasoning and formal systems.
- **Linguistics & Cosmos:** Defines the core laws and principles from which language and knowledge systems are constructed.

## Relation to Nomos and Inference

Axioms are the seeds from which nomoi (laws) and theorems grow. Inference is the process by which new truths are derived from axioms and existing knowledge.
