# Authorization

## Definition

Authorization is the process of granting or denying specific permissions to users, devices, or systems after their identity has been authenticated. It determines what actions are allowed, what resources can be accessed, and under what conditions. Authorization enforces security policies and supports the principle of least privilege.

## How It Works

After authentication, the system checks the user’s roles, group memberships, or attributes against access control lists (ACLs) or policies. Permissions may be granted for reading, writing, executing, or administering resources. Authorization can be fine-grained (per file or function) or broad (per application or network segment).

## Real-World Application

Authorization is used in operating systems, cloud platforms, databases, and enterprise applications. It protects sensitive data, enforces compliance, and supports collaboration. Role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) are common models.

Imagine a library where only certain people can enter special rooms or borrow rare books.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a video game where players unlock new levels and abilities as they progress—authorization determines who gets access to what.

## Why It Matters

Authorization ensures that resources are used appropriately, reducing risk and supporting secure, efficient operations.
