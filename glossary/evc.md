# EVC (Ethernet Virtual Circuit)

## Definition

An Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) is a logical connection in a carrier Ethernet network that enables data transport between two or more customer sites over a shared infrastructure. EVCs provide flexible, secure, and scalable connectivity for businesses.

## How It Works

EVCs are provisioned by service providers using VLANs, MPLS, or other technologies. They isolate customer traffic, ensure quality of service, and support point-to-point or multipoint connections. EVCs can be managed and monitored for performance and security.

## Real-World Application

Businesses use EVCs to connect branch offices, data centers, and cloud resources. EVCs support applications like VoIP, video conferencing, and disaster recovery.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a private express lane on a busy highway, reserved just for your company’s vehicles. Or picture a secure pipeline that delivers water only to your house, no matter how many other homes are on the block.

## Why It Matters

EVCs enable reliable, high-performance networking for modern enterprises.
