# Dual Stack

## Definition

Dual stack is a network configuration that enables devices to run both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols simultaneously. Dual stack supports a smooth transition to IPv6 as the internet outgrows the older IPv4 address space.

## How It Works

Devices and networks configured for dual stack can communicate using either protocol, choosing the best option for each connection. This ensures compatibility with legacy systems while enabling adoption of IPv6’s expanded address space and features.

## Real-World Application

ISPs, enterprises, and cloud providers use dual stack to support modern applications, global connectivity, and future growth. Dual stack is essential for IoT, mobile networks, and international expansion.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a bilingual translator who can speak two languages fluently, switching between them as needed. Or picture a bridge that connects two islands, allowing traffic to flow in both directions.

## Why It Matters

Dual stack ensures the internet remains accessible, scalable, and future-proof during the transition to IPv6.
