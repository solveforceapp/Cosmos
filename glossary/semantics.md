# Semantics

**Semantics** is the branch of linguistics and philosophy concerned with meaning—how words, phrases, sentences, and texts represent and convey meaning. It explores the relationship between signifiers (such as words and symbols) and what they stand for, both in language and in thought.

## Definition

Semantics investigates how meaning is constructed, interpreted, and communicated. It addresses questions such as: What does a word mean? How do sentences express propositions? How do context and culture shape meaning? Semantics is central to understanding how language functions as a tool for representing reality and sharing knowledge.

## Key Concepts

- **Lexical Semantics:** The meaning of individual words and their relationships (synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms).
- **Compositional Semantics:** How meanings of words combine to form the meaning of phrases and sentences.
- **Reference and Sense:** How language refers to objects, concepts, and states of affairs.
- **Pragmatics:** The role of context in shaping meaning.
- **Ambiguity and Polysemy:** How words and sentences can have multiple meanings.

## Applications

- **Natural Language Processing:** Enabling computers to understand and generate meaning from text.
- **Translation:** Preserving meaning across languages.
- **Philosophy of Language:** Analyzing the nature of meaning and reference.
- **Education:** Teaching vocabulary and reading comprehension.

## Relation to Linguistics, Lanomics, and Cosmos

Semantics is a core area of linguistics and is essential to lanomics, which studies language as a system of meaning. In the Cosmos framework, semantics connects language to knowledge, cognition, and the structure of reality.
