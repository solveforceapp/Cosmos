# DRaaS (Disaster Recovery as a Service)

## Definition

Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) is a cloud-based service that provides backup, recovery, and failover solutions to ensure business continuity after a disaster or outage. DRaaS enables organizations to restore systems and data quickly, minimizing downtime and loss.

## How It Works

DRaaS providers replicate data and applications to secure, remote servers. In the event of a failure, organizations can switch to the backup environment, maintaining operations until primary systems are restored. DRaaS includes monitoring, testing, and support.

## Real-World Application

Businesses of all sizes use DRaaS to protect against cyberattacks, hardware failures, and natural disasters. DRaaS is essential for compliance, customer trust, and operational resilience.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a backup generator that powers your home during a blackout, keeping the lights on until the main grid is fixed. Or picture a superhero sidekick who steps in when the hero is down.

## Why It Matters

DRaaS makes disaster recovery accessible, affordable, and reliable, supporting the modern digital economy.
