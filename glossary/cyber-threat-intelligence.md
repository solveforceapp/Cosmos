# Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

## Definition

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the collection, analysis, and sharing of information about current and emerging cyber threats. CTI helps organizations defend against attacks, anticipate risks, and improve their security posture.

## How It Works

CTI sources include threat feeds, incident reports, and dark web monitoring. Analysts identify indicators of compromise, track threat actors, and share findings with peers and law enforcement.

## Real-World Application

CTI is used by security teams, governments, and critical infrastructure providers to detect attacks, inform defenses, and coordinate responses.

Imagine a digital weather forecast that warns you of incoming storms, helping you prepare and stay safe.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a detective agency that uncovers cybercriminal plots before they unfold, keeping your systems one step ahead.

## Why It Matters

CTI empowers organizations to be proactive, not just reactive, in the fight against cyber threats.
