# Calling Party Pays

## Definition

Calling Party Pays (CPP) is a billing model in telecommunications where the person who initiates a call is responsible for all charges, while the receiving party pays nothing. CPP is common in mobile networks in many countries, shaping user behavior and pricing strategies.

## How It Works

When a call is made, the originating network bills the caller for the entire cost, including any interconnection fees. The recipient’s network delivers the call without charging the receiver. CPP contrasts with models where both parties share costs or the receiver pays (as in collect calls).

## Real-World Application

CPP is used in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, influencing how people use mobile phones. It encourages call initiation and simplifies billing. In the U.S., the Receiving Party Pays (RPP) model is more common for mobile-to-mobile calls.

Imagine a dinner party where the host pays for all the food and drinks, letting guests enjoy themselves without worry.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a taxi ride where only the passenger who hails the cab pays the fare, while others ride for free.

## Why It Matters

CPP affects telecom economics, user habits, and competition, making it a key concept in global communications.
