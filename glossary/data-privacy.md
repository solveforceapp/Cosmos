# Data Privacy

## Definition

Data privacy is the protection of personal or sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. It ensures individuals’ rights and compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.

## How It Works

Organizations implement privacy policies, consent mechanisms, and security controls. Data is anonymized, encrypted, and access is restricted to authorized users.

## Real-World Application

Data privacy is essential for healthcare, finance, and social media. It builds trust and prevents identity theft, discrimination, and reputational harm.

Imagine a locked diary that only you can read, keeping your secrets safe from prying eyes.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a privacy shield that follows you online, blocking unwanted snoops and advertisers.

## Why It Matters

Data privacy is a fundamental right in the digital age, shaping how we share and protect information.
