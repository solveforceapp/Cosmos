# Endpoint Security

## Definition

Endpoint security is the practice of securing endpoints or entry points of end-user devices—such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets—from being exploited by malicious actors or software. It is a key component of organizational cybersecurity.

## How It Works

Endpoint security solutions include antivirus, encryption, device management, and threat detection. Policies and controls ensure only authorized devices and users can access sensitive data or networks.

## Real-World Application

Businesses, schools, and healthcare providers use endpoint security to protect data, maintain compliance, and support remote work. It is essential for defending against malware, phishing, and data breaches.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a security checkpoint at every door, verifying each visitor’s identity before letting them in. Or picture a digital shield that blocks unwanted guests from entering your home.

## Why It Matters

Endpoint security safeguards information, supports productivity, and builds trust in digital environments.
