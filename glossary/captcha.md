# CAPTCHA

## Definition

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a security mechanism used to distinguish human users from automated bots. CAPTCHAs protect online services from abuse, spam, and fraud by presenting challenges that are easy for humans but difficult for machines.

## How It Works

CAPTCHAs may require users to enter distorted text, solve puzzles, select images, or complete logic tasks. Advanced CAPTCHAs use behavioral analysis or risk scoring. The goal is to block automated scripts while minimizing inconvenience for real users.

## Real-World Application

CAPTCHAs are used on websites, registration forms, ticketing systems, and e-commerce platforms. They prevent fake accounts, ticket scalping, and brute-force attacks. Accessibility and user experience are important considerations in CAPTCHA design.

Imagine a bouncer at a club who asks a question only a real person can answer before letting you in.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a riddle at the entrance to a secret garden, where only those who solve it can enter and enjoy the flowers.

## Why It Matters

CAPTCHAs help keep the internet safe and fair, balancing security and usability for everyone.
