# Inference

**Inference** is the process of drawing logical conclusions from premises, evidence, or axioms. It is the engine of reasoning, enabling the generation of new knowledge from existing truths. In the Cosmos knowledge base, inference connects principles, axioms, and laws (nomoi), allowing for the expansion and unification of knowledge.

## Definition

Inference involves moving from known facts or assumptions to new conclusions, using rules of logic or probability. It is fundamental to mathematics, science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence.

## Types of Inference

- **Deductive:** Deriving specific conclusions from general axioms or laws.
- **Inductive:** Generalizing from specific observations to broader principles.
- **Abductive:** Inferring the most likely explanation from incomplete data.

## Applications

- **Mathematics & Logic:** Proving theorems and establishing consistency.
- **Science:** Formulating hypotheses and theories.
- **AI & Language:** Enabling machines to reason, learn, and understand.
- **Cosmos Knowledge Base:** Connecting concepts, laws, and systems.

## Relation to Axioms, Nomos, and Principles

Inference is the bridge between foundational truths (axioms), governing laws (nomoi), and emergent knowledge. It is the process by which the architecture of meaning is constructed and expanded.
