# Cookie

## Definition

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on a user’s device by a website to remember preferences, track activity, or manage sessions. Cookies enhance user experience and enable personalized services.

## How It Works

Websites create cookies when you visit, saving information like login status, language, or shopping cart contents. Browsers send cookies back to the site on future visits. Cookies can be session-based (temporary) or persistent (long-term).

## Real-World Application

Cookies power features like auto-login, targeted ads, and analytics. Privacy regulations require websites to disclose cookie use and obtain consent.

Imagine a digital notepad that remembers your favorite settings every time you return to a website.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a friendly doorman who always greets you by name and knows your favorite drink.

## Why It Matters

Cookies make the web more convenient and personalized, but also raise important privacy considerations.
