# Cyber Insurance

## Definition

Cyber insurance is a type of insurance policy that helps organizations mitigate financial losses from cyberattacks, data breaches, and other digital security incidents. It covers costs such as legal fees, notification expenses, and recovery efforts.

## How It Works

Cyber insurance policies vary, but typically cover first-party losses (like data restoration) and third-party liabilities (such as lawsuits). Insurers assess risk, set premiums, and may require security controls as a condition of coverage.

## Real-World Application

Cyber insurance is used by businesses, governments, and nonprofits to manage cyber risk and ensure resilience. It supports incident response, regulatory compliance, and business continuity.

Imagine a safety net that catches you if you fall victim to a digital heist, helping you get back on your feet quickly.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a superhero insurance agent who swoops in after a cyberattack, helping you recover your data and reputation.

## Why It Matters

Cyber insurance is an essential tool for managing the financial impact of cyber threats in a connected world.
