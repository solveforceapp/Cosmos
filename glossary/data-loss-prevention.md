# Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

## Definition

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) refers to technologies and policies designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized transmission, sharing, or leakage of sensitive data outside an organization. DLP safeguards intellectual property, customer information, and compliance data.

## How It Works

DLP tools monitor network traffic, emails, and endpoints for risky behavior. Policies define what data is sensitive and how it should be protected. Alerts and automated actions help prevent leaks.

## Real-World Application

DLP is used in finance, healthcare, and government to comply with regulations and protect against insider threats.

Imagine a security guard who checks every package leaving a building, ensuring nothing valuable slips through unnoticed.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a digital watchdog that barks whenever someone tries to sneak out secret files.

## Why It Matters

DLP is a critical defense against data breaches and regulatory penalties.
