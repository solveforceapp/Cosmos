# Principle

A **principle** is a fundamental truth, rule, or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief, behavior, or reasoning. Principles guide the development of concepts, the formulation of axioms, and the establishment of laws (nomoi) within any domain of knowledge. In the Cosmos knowledge base, principles are the starting points for organizing, standardizing, and unifying knowledge.

## Definition

A principle is a basic assumption or guideline that informs the structure and operation of a system. Principles are often more general than axioms and can be observed, inferred, or postulated.

## Key Features

- **Foundational:** Underlies concepts, axioms, and laws.
- **Guiding:** Directs reasoning, design, and behavior.
- **Universal or Contextual:** May apply broadly or within a specific domain.

## Applications

- **Science:** Principles such as conservation of energy or natural selection.
- **Ethics:** Principles like justice or autonomy.
- **Linguistics & Cosmos:** Principles of structure, meaning, and coherence.

## Relation to Axioms, Nomos, and Inference

Principles inspire the formulation of axioms and laws. Inference is used to derive new knowledge from principles and axioms.
