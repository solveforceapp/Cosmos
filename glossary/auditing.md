# Auditing

## Definition

Auditing is the systematic process of collecting, examining, and evaluating information about assets, systems, or processes to ensure compliance with policies, standards, and regulations. In IT and cybersecurity, auditing helps organizations identify vulnerabilities, detect anomalies, and maintain accountability.

## How It Works

Auditors gather data from logs, configurations, and user activities. They analyze this information to verify that controls are in place, policies are followed, and risks are managed. Auditing can be manual or automated, and may focus on security, financial, or operational aspects.

## Real-World Application

Auditing is essential for regulatory compliance (such as GDPR, HIPAA, or SOX), risk management, and incident response. Organizations conduct regular audits to assess security posture, detect fraud, and improve processes. Automated auditing tools streamline data collection and reporting.

Imagine a detective reviewing evidence to solve a case—auditing uncovers the truth behind system activity.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a referee watching a game, ensuring everyone follows the rules and calling out fouls when necessary.

## Why It Matters

Auditing builds trust, transparency, and resilience in organizations, helping them meet legal obligations and protect valuable assets.
