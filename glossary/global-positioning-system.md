# Global Positioning System (GPS)

## Definition

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system that provides location, timing, and navigation information to devices worldwide. GPS is essential for navigation, mapping, and location-based services in everyday life.

## How It Works

GPS uses a constellation of satellites orbiting Earth, ground stations, and receivers. By triangulating signals from multiple satellites, a GPS receiver can determine its precise position anywhere on the planet. GPS is free to use and operates 24/7, in all weather conditions.

## Real-World Application

GPS powers navigation in cars, airplanes, ships, and smartphones. It supports emergency response, logistics, agriculture, and scientific research. Location-based apps, fitness trackers, and geocaching all rely on GPS.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a digital compass that always knows where you are, guiding you through city streets or wilderness trails. Or picture a treasure map that updates in real time as you move.

## Why It Matters

GPS connects the world, enhances safety, and enables countless innovations in technology and society.
