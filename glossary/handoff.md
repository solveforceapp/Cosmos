# Handoff

## Definition

Handoff is the process in mobile networks where an active call or data session is transferred from one cell tower or base station to another without interruption. Handoffs ensure seamless connectivity as users move through different coverage areas.

## How It Works

When a mobile device detects a stronger signal from a neighboring tower, the network coordinates a handoff to maintain the call or data session. There are hard and soft handoffs, depending on the technology used.

## Real-World Application

Handoffs are essential for uninterrupted phone calls, video streaming, and mobile internet access while traveling. They are used in cellular, Wi-Fi, and satellite networks.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine passing a baton in a relay race without dropping it, or switching lanes on a highway without slowing down. Or picture a conversation that continues smoothly as you walk from room to room.

## Why It Matters

Handoffs enable mobility, convenience, and reliability in wireless communications.
