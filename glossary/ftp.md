# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

## Definition

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between computers over a TCP/IP network, such as the internet. FTP is one of the oldest and most widely used methods for moving data online.

## How It Works

FTP uses a client-server model, where users connect to an FTP server to upload or download files. FTP can operate in active or passive mode and supports authentication for secure access. Modern alternatives include SFTP and FTPS, which add encryption.

## Real-World Application

FTP is used by web developers, businesses, and researchers to share files, update websites, and exchange large datasets. Many hosting providers offer FTP access for managing website content.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a digital courier service that picks up packages from your computer and delivers them to a friend across the world. Or picture a library where you can borrow or return books at any time, day or night.

## Why It Matters

FTP laid the foundation for file sharing and collaboration on the internet, enabling global connectivity.
