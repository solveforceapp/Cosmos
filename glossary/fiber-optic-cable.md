# Fiber Optic Cable

## Definition

Fiber optic cable is a high-speed transmission medium that uses strands of glass or plastic fibers to transmit data as pulses of light. Fiber optics offer unparalleled bandwidth, low latency, and resistance to electromagnetic interference.

## How It Works

Data is encoded into light signals and sent through the fiber, bouncing off the walls by total internal reflection. Repeaters and amplifiers extend the range for long-distance communication. Fiber cables can carry multiple wavelengths (colors) of light for even greater capacity.

## Real-World Application

Fiber optics power the internet backbone, connect data centers, and deliver gigabit broadband to homes and businesses. They are used in medical imaging, military systems, and industrial automation.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a superhighway made of glass, where cars (data) travel at the speed of light with no traffic jams. Or picture a laser pointer sending secret messages through a crystal-clear tunnel.

## Why It Matters

Fiber optic cables enable the fast, reliable, and scalable networks that drive the digital age.
