# Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

## Definition

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a digital cellular technology that allows multiple users to share the same frequency band by assigning unique codes to each call or data session. This improves capacity, security, and call quality in wireless networks.

## How It Works

CDMA encodes each user’s signal with a unique code, enabling simultaneous transmission over the same frequency. Receivers use the code to extract the intended signal, filtering out others. CDMA is resistant to interference and eavesdropping.

## Real-World Application

CDMA is used in mobile networks, satellite communications, and military systems. It supports voice, text, and data services, enabling efficient spectrum use and secure connections.

Imagine a crowded room where everyone speaks a different language—each conversation is private, even though everyone shares the same space.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a radio station where every DJ plays a different song, but listeners only hear their favorite by tuning in to the right code.

## Why It Matters

CDMA revolutionized wireless communication, making mobile networks more efficient and secure.
