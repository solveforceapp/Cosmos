# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

## Definition

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity solution that monitors, detects, and responds to threats on endpoints—such as computers, servers, and mobile devices. EDR provides real-time visibility, threat intelligence, and automated remediation to protect organizations from advanced attacks.

## How It Works

EDR tools collect and analyze data from endpoints, looking for suspicious behavior, malware, or policy violations. When a threat is detected, EDR can isolate the device, remove malicious files, and alert security teams. EDR integrates with other security systems for coordinated defense.

## Real-World Application

Businesses use EDR to defend against ransomware, insider threats, and zero-day exploits. EDR is essential for compliance and incident response in regulated industries.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a security robot patrolling every room in a building, instantly locking down any area where trouble is detected. Or picture a digital watchdog that barks at the first sign of danger.

## Why It Matters

EDR strengthens endpoint security, reduces response times, and helps organizations stay ahead of evolving cyber threats.
