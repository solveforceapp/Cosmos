# Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

## Definition

A Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is an error-detecting code used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. CRCs help ensure data integrity during transmission and storage.

## How It Works

CRCs use polynomial division to generate a short, fixed-length value from a block of data. The sender calculates the CRC and appends it to the data. The receiver recalculates the CRC and compares it to the original. A mismatch indicates an error.

## Real-World Application

CRCs are used in Ethernet, disk drives, and file formats like ZIP. They detect errors caused by noise, interference, or hardware faults.

Imagine a digital fingerprint that verifies every message, ensuring nothing was lost or changed along the way.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a librarian who checks every returned book for missing pages before putting it back on the shelf.

## Why It Matters

CRCs are a simple but powerful tool for reliable communication and storage.
