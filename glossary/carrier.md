# Carrier

## Definition

A carrier is a telecommunications service provider that owns, operates, and maintains the infrastructure needed to deliver voice, data, and internet services to customers. Carriers are the backbone of global connectivity, enabling communication across cities, countries, and continents.

## How It Works

Carriers build and manage networks of cables, switches, routers, and wireless towers. They offer services such as phone lines, broadband, mobile, and leased circuits. Carriers may be national, regional, or global, and often interconnect with each other to extend coverage.

## Real-World Application

Major carriers include AT&T, Verizon, BT, and Deutsche Telekom. They serve residential, business, and government customers, supporting everything from phone calls to cloud computing. Carriers compete on price, quality, and innovation.

Imagine a network of highways built and maintained by a company, allowing people and goods to travel anywhere they need to go.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a fleet of ships sailing the world’s oceans, carrying messages and packages between distant lands.

## Why It Matters

Carriers make modern life possible, connecting people, businesses, and ideas around the globe.
