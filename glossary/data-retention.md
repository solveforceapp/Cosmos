# Data Retention

## Definition

Data retention refers to the policies and practices that determine how long data is stored, archived, or deleted. Retention policies help organizations comply with legal, regulatory, or business requirements.

## How It Works

Retention schedules specify timeframes for keeping different types of data. Automated tools manage archiving and deletion, reducing risk and storage costs.

## Real-World Application

Data retention is critical in finance, healthcare, and government. It supports audits, investigations, and privacy rights.

Imagine a library with a strict schedule for keeping and discarding books, ensuring only relevant information is available.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a digital janitor who sweeps away old files, keeping your systems tidy and compliant.

## Why It Matters

Data retention balances operational needs, legal obligations, and privacy concerns.
