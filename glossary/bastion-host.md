# Bastion Host

## Definition

A bastion host is a specially secured computer system that acts as a gateway between an external network (such as the internet) and a protected internal network. Bastion hosts are designed to withstand attacks, monitor traffic, and provide controlled access to sensitive resources.

## How It Works

Bastion hosts are hardened by disabling unnecessary services, applying strict firewall rules, and monitoring for suspicious activity. They often serve as jump servers, proxy servers, or VPN endpoints, allowing administrators to manage internal systems securely. All traffic to the internal network passes through the bastion host, which logs and inspects connections.

## Real-World Application

Bastion hosts are used in enterprise IT, cloud environments, and critical infrastructure. They support secure remote administration, compliance, and incident response. By isolating and controlling access, bastion hosts reduce the attack surface and protect valuable assets.

Imagine a fortress gatehouse where every visitor is checked, logged, and escorted before entering the castle.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a bouncer at an exclusive club who inspects every guest, checks their credentials, and keeps troublemakers out.

## Why It Matters

Bastion hosts are a vital defense in depth strategy, enabling secure, auditable access to critical systems.
