# Cloud Native

## Definition

Cloud native is a software development approach that leverages cloud computing frameworks, microservices, containers, and DevOps practices to build applications that are scalable, resilient, and flexible. Cloud native applications are designed to fully exploit the advantages of cloud environments.

## How It Works

Cloud native development uses loosely coupled microservices, containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD). This enables rapid updates, fault tolerance, and efficient resource use.

## Real-World Application

Cloud native is used by tech giants, startups, and enterprises to deliver web apps, APIs, and digital services at scale. It supports innovation, faster time-to-market, and seamless scaling to meet demand.

Imagine building with LEGO blocks—each piece (microservice) can be swapped, upgraded, or replaced without affecting the whole structure.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a team of chefs in a cloud kitchen, each preparing a dish independently, but all contributing to a grand feast.

## Why It Matters

Cloud native unlocks agility, speed, and reliability, powering the next generation of digital experiences.
