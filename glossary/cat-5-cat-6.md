# Cat 5/Cat 6

## Definition

Cat 5 and Cat 6 are categories of twisted pair cables used for Ethernet and other data transmission in local area networks (LANs). These cables support both voice and data, providing reliable, high-speed connectivity in homes and businesses.

## How It Works

Cat 5 cables support speeds up to 100 Mbps, while Cat 6 can handle up to 10 Gbps over short distances. Both use four pairs of copper wires, with improved insulation and reduced crosstalk in Cat 6. Connectors (RJ-45) make installation easy and standardized.

## Real-World Application

Cat 5 and Cat 6 cables are the backbone of wired networks, connecting computers, switches, routers, and phones. They are used in offices, schools, data centers, and smart homes. Upgrading to Cat 6 supports future-proofing and higher bandwidth needs.

Imagine a set of superhighways for digital traffic, with Cat 6 offering more lanes and smoother rides than Cat 5.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a race between two delivery trucks—one on a bumpy road (Cat 5), the other on a freshly paved expressway (Cat 6).

## Why It Matters

Choosing the right cable ensures fast, reliable communication and supports the demands of modern technology.
