# Distributed Antenna System (DAS)

## Definition

A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is a network of spatially separated antennas connected to a common source, used to improve wireless coverage in buildings, stadiums, airports, or large areas. DAS ensures strong, reliable signals where traditional antennas fall short.

## How It Works

DAS distributes radio frequency (RF) signals from a central source to multiple antennas, which rebroadcast the signal throughout the area. This overcomes obstacles like walls or distance, providing consistent coverage. DAS can support cellular, Wi-Fi, public safety, and other wireless services.

## Real-World Application

Stadiums, hospitals, office towers, and transit systems use DAS to ensure seamless connectivity for users, emergency responders, and IoT devices. DAS is critical for safety, productivity, and customer satisfaction.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a team of relay runners passing the baton to cover every corner of a race track. Or picture a network of lighthouses guiding ships safely to shore.

## Why It Matters

DAS enables reliable wireless communication in challenging environments, supporting modern life and safety.
