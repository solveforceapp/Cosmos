# Encryption

## Definition

Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality during storage or transmission. It is a fundamental technology for privacy and security in the digital world.

## How It Works

Encryption uses algorithms and keys to scramble information so that only authorized parties can decode it. There are symmetric (same key for encryption and decryption) and asymmetric (public/private key pairs) methods. Encryption is used in everything from web browsing (HTTPS) to messaging apps and cloud storage.

## Real-World Application

Banks encrypt transactions, businesses protect customer data, and individuals use encrypted messaging to keep conversations private. Encryption is also used in securing Wi-Fi, emails, and backups.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine sending a secret message in a locked box that only the recipient has the key to open. Or picture a diary written in a code only you and your best friend understand.

## Why It Matters

Encryption safeguards privacy, builds trust, and enables secure digital interactions across the globe.
