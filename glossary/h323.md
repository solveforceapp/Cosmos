# H.323

## Definition

H.323 is a set of protocols for voice, video, and data communications over packet-switched networks, widely used in VoIP and videoconferencing systems. H.323 enables interoperability and quality in real-time communications.

## How It Works

H.323 defines signaling, control, and media transport for multimedia sessions. It supports call setup, management, and termination, as well as audio, video, and data sharing.

## Real-World Application

Businesses, schools, and governments use H.323 for video meetings, telemedicine, and distance learning. It is a foundation for many unified communications platforms.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a universal translator that lets people from different countries talk face-to-face, or a video phone that connects families across continents. Or picture a digital conference room where everyone can join, no matter their device.

## Why It Matters

H.323 powers global collaboration, innovation, and connection in the digital age.
