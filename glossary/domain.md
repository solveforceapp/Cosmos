# Domain

## Definition

A domain is a unique name that identifies a website or network on the internet, such as example.com. Domains are used for addressing, branding, and access to online resources.

## How It Works

Domains are registered through accredited registrars and managed by the Domain Name System (DNS). Each domain can have subdomains (like mail.example.com) and is mapped to IP addresses. Domains are renewed periodically and can be transferred or sold.

## Real-World Application

Businesses, individuals, and organizations use domains for websites, email, and online services. Domains support digital marketing, e-commerce, and global communication. Domain disputes and cyber-squatting are managed by legal frameworks.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a personalized license plate for your car, making it easy to find and remember. Or picture a storefront sign that draws customers to your shop.

## Why It Matters

Domains are the foundation of digital identity and presence. They enable discovery, trust, and connection online.
