# Directory Services

## Definition

Directory services are network services that store, organize, and provide access to information about users, devices, and resources. Examples include Microsoft Active Directory and LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

## How It Works

Directory services maintain a hierarchical database of objects, such as users, computers, printers, and groups. Administrators use directory services to manage authentication, authorization, and policies across networks. Directory services support single sign-on, access control, and resource discovery.

## Real-World Application

Enterprises, schools, and cloud providers use directory services to manage large numbers of users and devices. They enable secure logins, group policies, and centralized management. Directory services are critical for compliance and security.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a digital phone book that not only lists everyone’s number but also controls who can call whom and when. Or picture a library catalog that manages access to every book, room, and computer.

## Why It Matters

Directory services simplify IT management, enhance security, and support scalable, flexible networks.
