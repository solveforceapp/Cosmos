# Dial Tone

## Definition

A dial tone is the continuous tone heard on a telephone line indicating that the line is active and ready to make a call. It is a familiar sound in traditional telephony, signaling that the system is working and awaiting input.

## How It Works

When a phone is lifted off the hook, the exchange sends a steady tone to the handset. The user then dials a number, and the system routes the call. Dial tones vary by country and technology, but their purpose is universal: to reassure users and prompt action.

## Real-World Application

Dial tones are used in landline phones, PBX systems, and some VoIP services. They help users know when a line is available and ready. In digital systems, visual or audio cues may replace the traditional tone.

## Entertaining Example

Imagine a friendly operator saying, “I’m here and ready to connect you!” every time you pick up the phone. Or picture a green light that turns on when a device is ready for use.

## Why It Matters

Dial tones are a simple but effective way to communicate system status, improving user experience and confidence in technology.
