# CSP (Cloud Solution Provider)

## Definition

A Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) is a business model and partner program where companies resell cloud services, manage customer accounts, and provide support. CSPs act as intermediaries between cloud vendors (like Microsoft, AWS, or Google Cloud) and end customers.

## How It Works

CSPs bundle cloud products, offer billing and support, and may provide consulting or managed services. They help customers select, deploy, and optimize cloud solutions, often adding value through integration and customization.

## Real-World Application

CSPs are used by businesses seeking expert guidance, simplified billing, and ongoing support for cloud adoption. They enable digital transformation and cloud migration for organizations of all sizes.

Imagine a travel agent who plans your entire trip, books your tickets, and helps you navigate every step of the journey.

## Entertaining Example

## Why It Matters

CSPs accelerate cloud adoption, making advanced technology accessible and manageable for everyone.
