# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Definition

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. XSS can steal data, hijack sessions, or compromise accounts, posing serious risks to users and organizations.

## How It Works

Attackers exploit input fields or URLs to insert scripts, which are then executed in the victim’s browser. XSS can be persistent (stored), reflected, or DOM-based. Defenses include input validation, output encoding, and security headers.

## Real-World Application

XSS is a common target in bug bounty programs and a top concern in web application security. Developers use frameworks and tools to detect and prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Imagine a prankster sneaking a fake message onto a public bulletin board, tricking others into revealing secrets.

## Entertaining Example

Picture a magician who slips a hidden message into a newspaper, causing readers to act on his secret commands.

## Why It Matters

XSS undermines trust in web applications, making robust security practices essential for safe online experiences.
