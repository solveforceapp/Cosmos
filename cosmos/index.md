# Cosmos

The cosmos is the all-encompassing system—the total structure of reality, order, and meaning. This section explores the foundational principles, laws, and architecture that define the cosmos, both as a physical universe and as a semantic framework.

## Overview

Cosmos is not just the universe, but the logic, order, and relationships that give rise to meaning and existence. It is the sum of:
- Physical laws
- Semantic structures
- Recursion and emergence
- Communication and intelligence

## Key Topics

- [Communication Laws](communication-laws.md): Principles governing information flow.
- [Definition](definition.md): What is the cosmos?
- [Etymology](etymology.md): Origins of the term and concept.
- [Logos](logos.md): The logic and reason underlying the cosmos.
- [Recursion Laws](recursion-laws.md): Self-similarity and emergence.
- [Semantic Architecture](semantic-architecture.md): The structure of meaning.

## The Structure of the Cosmos

The cosmos is layered:
1. Physical substrate (matter, energy, space, time)
2. Information and communication
3. Semantic and symbolic systems
4. Intelligence and agency

## Laws and Patterns

- Conservation and transformation
- Recursion and fractals
- Symmetry and asymmetry
- Causality and correlation

## Cosmos in Human Thought

- Mythology and cosmology
- Philosophy and metaphysics
- Science and mathematics
- Digital and virtual worlds

## Cosmos as a Knowledge System

- Ontologies and taxonomies
- Networks and graphs
- Feedback and adaptation
- Universal computation

The cosmos is the ultimate context—the system of systems, the architecture of meaning, and the foundation of all knowledge.
