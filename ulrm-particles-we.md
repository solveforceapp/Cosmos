# ULRM Particles: WE

This page will serve as a dedicated reference for the "WE" particle within the Unified Linguistic Reality Model (ULRM+). It will be expanded to include definitions, theoretical context, diagrams, and applications as the ULRM+ system evolves.

## Definition

**WE** is a core linguistic particle in the ULRM+ system, representing the collective, first-person plural perspective. It is not merely a pronoun, but a structural unit that encodes the concept of shared agency, collective identity, and distributed intentionality within the architecture of language and cognition.

## Theoretical Context

In the ULRM+, particles like "WE" are not just grammatical markers, but fundamental building blocks of meaning. The "WE" particle:

- Encapsulates the notion of group consciousness and collective action.
- Serves as a bridge between individual cognition and social structure.
- Is mapped to specific layers in the ULRM+ phenomenological stack, especially those dealing with social interaction, communication, and distributed agency.

```

## Applications

- **Linguistics:** Analyzing how languages encode collective agency and group identity.
- **AI & NLP:** Designing systems that can reason about group actions, consensus, and distributed decision-making.
- **Philosophy:** Exploring the boundaries between self and other, and the emergence of "we-ness" in consciousness studies.
- **Sociology:** Modeling how collective intentionality shapes social norms, cooperation, and conflict.
