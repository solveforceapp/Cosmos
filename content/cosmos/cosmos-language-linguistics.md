# Cosmos, Language, and Linguistics: Mapping the Architecture of Knowledge

The Cosmos knowledge base is built on the foundation of linguistics—the scientific study of language. By analyzing the structure, function, and evolution of language, linguistics provides the tools to map the architecture of knowledge and meaning within the cosmos.

## Cosmos: The Context for Language

The cosmos is the all-encompassing system in which language, knowledge, and meaning arise. Its laws and structures are mirrored in the organization of language.

## Language: The Medium of Meaning

Language encodes and transmits the concepts, laws, and experiences that define reality. Its structure and evolution are central to the Cosmos knowledge base.

## Linguistics: The Science of Language

Linguistics investigates the sounds, words, grammar, and meanings that make up language. It connects the study of language to cognition, society, and the evolution of knowledge.

## Integration in the Cosmos Knowledge Base

By integrating cosmos, language, and linguistics, the knowledge base provides a unified framework for mapping, analyzing, and evolving meaning across domains.
