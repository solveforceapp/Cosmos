# Cosmos, Language, and Semantics: The Meaning of Reality

The Cosmos knowledge base unites the study of the universe with the science of meaning—semantics. By analyzing how language encodes, transmits, and transforms meaning, semantics provides the foundation for understanding knowledge, communication, and reality itself.

## Cosmos: The System of Meaning

The cosmos is not just a physical system; it is a semantic system, structured by laws, patterns, and relationships. Language is the primary tool for mapping, describing, and navigating this system.

## Language: The Medium of Meaning

Language encodes the rules, concepts, and experiences that define reality. Its structure and evolution are central to the Cosmos knowledge base.

## Semantics: The Science of Meaning

Semantics investigates how words, phrases, and sentences represent and convey meaning. It connects language to thought, reality, and the architecture of knowledge.

## Integration in the Cosmos Knowledge Base

By integrating cosmos, language, and semantics, the knowledge base provides a unified framework for mapping, analyzing, and evolving meaning across domains.
