# Lanomics and Autonomics: Systems of Language

**Lanomics** and **autonomics** are emerging fields that apply systems thinking to the study of language and autonomous systems. Together, they provide a framework for understanding how language operates as a complex, adaptive, and self-organizing system within the broader cosmos.

## Lanomics: The Economics of Language Systems

Lanomics views language as a dynamic network of interacting units—sounds, words, rules, and meanings—governed by internal laws and external pressures. It draws on linguistics, network theory, and information science to model how languages evolve, compete, and adapt.

### Key Areas

- **Language Networks:** Mapping connections between words, speakers, and communities.
- **Emergence:** How new words, meanings, and structures arise from interactions.
- **Adaptation:** How language changes in response to social, technological, and cognitive forces.

## Autonomics: The Science of Self-Governing Systems

Autonomics studies how systems (biological, technological, linguistic) achieve autonomy—self-regulation, learning, and adaptation. In language, autonomics explores how linguistic systems maintain coherence, resist entropy, and evolve new forms.

### Key Areas

- **Self-Organization:** How language rules and patterns emerge without central control.
- **Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for error correction and innovation.
- **Resilience:** How languages survive, split, or merge over time.

## Integration in the Cosmos Knowledge Base

Lanomics and autonomics are central to the SolveForce vision of the cosmos as a semantic architecture. They bridge linguistics, cybernetics, and systems theory, enabling a unified understanding of how meaning is generated, transmitted, and transformed.
