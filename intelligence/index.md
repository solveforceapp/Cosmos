# Intelligence

Intelligence is the capacity to learn, adapt, reason, and create. This section explores the foundations, forms, and frontiers of intelligence in natural and artificial systems.

## Overview

Intelligence manifests as:
- Perception and understanding
- Learning and memory
- Problem-solving and creativity
- Communication and collaboration

## Key Topics

- [Artificial Intelligence](artificial-intelligence.md): Machines that learn and reason.
- [Deep Learning](deep-learning.md): Neural networks and representation learning.
- [Linguistic Recursion](linguistic-recursion.md): The structure of language and thought.
- [Machine Learning](machine-learning.md): Algorithms that adapt from data.
- [Natural Language Processing](natural-language-processing.md): Understanding and generating human language.

## Types of Intelligence

- Biological (humans, animals, plants)
- Artificial (AI, robots, agents)
- Collective (groups, swarms, organizations)
- Hybrid (human-AI collaboration)

## Theories and Models

- Symbolic vs. connectionist
- Bayesian inference
- Evolutionary computation
- Cognitive architectures

## Applications

- Automation and robotics
- Language and translation
- Decision support
- Creativity and art

## Challenges

- Bias and fairness
- Explainability
- Generalization
- Safety and alignment

## Future Directions

- Artificial general intelligence
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Emergent intelligence
