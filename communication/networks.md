# Networks

Networks are the interconnected pathways that enable the flow of information, energy, and resources across the cosmos. They are the architecture of connectivity, linking nodes—whether people, machines, or systems—into dynamic, adaptive webs.

## What is a Network?

A network consists of:
- Nodes (entities, devices, or points)
- Links (connections or relationships)
- Topology (the arrangement of nodes and links)

## Types of Networks

- Communication networks (telecom, internet)
- Biological networks (neural, ecological)
- Social networks (people, organizations)
- Computer networks (LAN, WAN, cloud)
- Transportation networks (roads, logistics)

## Network Properties

- Scalability
- Robustness
- Redundancy
- Latency
- Bandwidth
- Security

## Network Topologies

- Star
- Mesh
- Ring
- Tree
- Hybrid

## The Internet: The Ultimate Network

The internet is a global network of networks, connecting billions of devices and people. It enables:
- Instant communication
- Distributed computation
- Global collaboration

## Network Protocols

- TCP/IP
- HTTP/HTTPS
- DNS
- Routing protocols (BGP, OSPF)

## Network Evolution

Networks have evolved from:
1. Simple point-to-point links
2. Circuit-switched telephone systems
3. Packet-switched data networks
4. Wireless and mobile networks
5. Software-defined and quantum networks

## Challenges in Networking

- Congestion and bottlenecks
- Security threats
- Interoperability
- Privacy

## The Future of Networks

- 5G/6G and beyond
- Quantum networking
- Autonomous, self-healing networks
- Universal connectivity
