# Cybernetics

Cybernetics is the science of systems, control, and communication in animals, machines, and organizations. This section explores the principles, history, and applications of cybernetics across biology, technology, and society.

## Overview

Cybernetics studies how systems regulate themselves, adapt, and communicate. It bridges:
- Biology and engineering
- Feedback and control
- Information and computation
- Ethics and society

## Key Topics

- [Bio-cybernetics](bio-cybernetics.md): Control and communication in living systems.
- [Ethical Cybernetics](ethical-cybernetics.md): The moral dimensions of autonomous systems.
- [Machine Cybernetics](machine-cybernetics.md): Feedback and adaptation in technology.

## History

- Norbert Wiener and the birth of cybernetics
- Early applications in WWII
- Influence on computer science and AI
- Second-order cybernetics and self-reference

## Core Concepts

- Feedback loops
- Homeostasis and stability
- Adaptation and learning
- System boundaries and environments

## Applications

- Robotics and automation
