# COSMOS Knowledge Base

COSMOS is SolveForce's universal knowledge infrastructure—a structured, semantic content repository for foundational concepts, technologies, and definitions that power the digital cosmos.


## Structure

- All content is in Markdown (`.md`) files under `content/`.
- Major sections: Communication, Cosmos, Cybernetics, Glossary, Infrastructure, Intelligence, Services.
- Each section is a folder with atomic topic files and optional `index.md` for navigation.
- Cross-linking is done via relative Markdown links.


## How to Use

- Browse `content/index.md` for a homepage and navigation to all topics.
- Each section (e.g., `content/communication/`) contains focused `.md` files on subtopics.
- Glossary entries are single-term files for easy reference and linking.


## Authoring Guidelines

- Add new topics as new `.md` files in the correct subfolder.
- Update existing topics by editing the relevant Markdown file.
- Link related concepts using relative Markdown links.
- Follow lowercase, hyphen-separated naming for files and folders.
- Do not add code, scripts, or non-Markdown files.
