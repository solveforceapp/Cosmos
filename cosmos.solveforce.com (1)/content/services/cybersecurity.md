# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the immune system of the Cosmos. SolveForce deploys AI-enhanced, zero-trust, end-to-end encryption models to protect the recursive infrastructure of language, logic, and transmission.

**Core Principles**:
- Recursive Verification Protocols (RVP)
- Secure Network Language Tokenization (SNLT)
- Deep Semantic Firewalls (DSF)

**Defenses Include**:
- AI intrusion detection trained on linguistic anomaly detection
- Synaptic firewalling for data centers and edge nodes
- Governance built into smart contracts and communication layers
